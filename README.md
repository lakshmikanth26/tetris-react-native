- **Performance**: Optimized with proper memoization and efficient re-renders

## Project Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js              # Main game component with UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gameLogic.js        # Core Tetris game logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.json           # Expo configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json       # Dependencies and scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/           # App icons and splash screens
```

## Development

The game logic is completely separated from the UI, making it easy to:
- Add new features
- Modify game rules
- Change the visual design
- Add sound effects or animations

All game state is managed through React hooks, and the game loop uses `setInterval` for automatic piece falling with level-based speed adjustments.

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ iOS (Expo Go)
- ‚úÖ Android (Expo Go)  
- ‚úÖ Web (Expo for Web)
- ‚úÖ No ejecting required
- ‚úÖ Works with Expo SDK 49+

Enjoy playing Tetris! üéÆ
