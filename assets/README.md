# Assets Directory

This directory contains placeholder files for the Expo app. For a production app, you would replace these with actual icon and splash screen images:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1284x2778px for iPhone 12 Pro Max)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px)

For now, these are placeholder files. The app will work without them, but you may see warnings in the Expo development tools.
